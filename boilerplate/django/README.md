# Django Development Container

This development container boilerplate is suitable for Django projects.

## Poetry/pyproject.toml

An [example pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file has been included. The file should be edited to add the requirements for your project/define the other configuration.

When the container is created for the first time the [create.sh](.devcontainer/docker/scripts/create.sh) script will be executed which will install the various requirements for you.
